# Partial TextString for Umbraco

This is a small extension to a standard "Textbox" editor, that allows
you to specify a prefix and/or suffix string to show alongside the editor.

Sometimes that's much better than trying to use the description to explain
that you should only type in e.g. the username for an email account or similar.
